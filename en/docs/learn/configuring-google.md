# Configuring Google

Google can be used as a federated authenticator in WSO2 Identity
Server. Follow the instructions given below to configure WSO2 Identity Server to authenticate users using their Google user accounts.

1.  To navigate to the federated authenticators configuration section, follow the instructions given below.
    1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the [Management Console](../../setup/getting-started-with-the-management-console).
        
    2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu. Click **Add** under **Identity Providers**. For more information, see [Adding and Configuring an Identity Provider](../../learn/adding-and-configuring-an-identity-provider).
        
    3.  Fill in the details in the **Basic Information** section. 

2.  Register OAuth 2.0 Application in Google. First, go to [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
    and navigate to the **Credentials** tab from the sidebar. 
    
3.  Click **Create credentials** on the top navigation.

6.  Enter a name (e.g., SampleWebApplication). 
      
7.  Click **ADD URI** within **Authorized redirect URIs** and add `https://localhost:9443/commonauth` as a redirect URI (this is the WSO2 Identity Server endpoint that accepts the response sent by Google).

    | Callback Url                | This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected after the authentication is successful. It should have this format: `                               https://(host-name):(port)/commonauth                             ` . Here ACS URL (Assertion Consumer URL) is the endpoint in WSO2 Identity Server which accepts the response sent by Google. | https://localhost:9443/commonauth |
    | Additional Query Parameters | This is necessary if you are connecting to another Identity Server or application. Sometimes extra parameters are required by this IS or application so these can be specified here.                                                                                                                                                                  | scope=openid email profile        |
